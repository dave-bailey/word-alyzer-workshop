### Overview

This program intakes a word, analyzes it, and gives back a response dependent upon a variety of conditionals. Unfortunately, its code isn't written according to best practice. Having everything in nested `if... else` statements is a good way to confuse yourself and other developers. Refactor this program and gain better understanding of block scope as you do.

**There is no one solution to this workshop. It's an opportunity to think and explore!**

### Objective

Refactor the Word-alyzer to be a better written program.

### Topics

> - Conditional best practices
> - Refactoring
> - Block scope

### Context

The code presented here is more or less functional, but NOT anywhere near ideal. If you feel confused or disoriented reading this code, you are on the right track. Many things about this code can be refactored.

Refactored could mean cleaning up redundancies, reordering the logic, catching more edge cases, and so on. It's an example of what NOT to do in many ways. As you begin your journey as a programmer, your code may initially resemble this. Don't worry: writing better code is a skill you develop with time.
